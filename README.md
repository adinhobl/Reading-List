## Read

### Genetic Algorithms
* [Evolving simple programs for playing Atari games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05695):
    Evolving programs of scalar and matrix functions to play Atari games on pixel input. Generally programs found a simple way to consistently achieve decent results without much finesse. 

### Deep Learning
* [The deepest problem with deep learning](https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/the-deepest-problem-with-deep-learning-91c5991f5695): A defense of the idea that deep-learning is only a piece of the puzzle of AI. AI has a long way to go to approach general reasoning or logical abilities. Recommends symbol-manipulation.
    
* [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473v7.pdf): Uses an end-to-end learned architecture consisting of a bidirectional RNN encoder, an alignmnet layer, and an LSTM decoder to translate sentences from English to French. The bi-RNN encodes each word in a sentence and the dependencies on the words around it, which the decoder uses to produce each output word.
